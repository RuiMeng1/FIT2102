## Assessed exercises

This week's exercises will be more theoretical and shorter to allow time for working on your assignment.

There is no automated testing this week.  Check your work carefully.

Click on each exercise to display the instructions.

The exercises are to be done either digitally or on pen and paper, with the submission consisting of the source files (word doc, markdown, latex, etc.) if any and a pdf file of the final submission (scanned, photo, printed to pdf, compiled, etc.), all zipped into one archive.

If you submit a text file, you can write "λ" as ”\” (this is the haskell way).

## Supplementary activities

There is additional supplementary Observable and RxJS exercises with sample solutions on Moodle. These are for students who would like more practise on building more complex Observable programs and state management, particularly for the assignment.

The supplementary activities will **not** be assessed.
