# Workshop 2

This week we are working locally on our own machines or others' machines via vscode Liveshare.
You can run tests and show the html output on your local machine (requires node.js):
```
> npm install
```
Start tests:
```
> npm test
```
Show html output:
```
> npm run dev
```
then click on the ctrl-link displayed in your terminal.
